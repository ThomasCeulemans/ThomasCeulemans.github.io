abstract = {Radiative transfer is essential in astronomy, both for interpreting observations and simulating various astrophysical phenomena. However, self-consistent line radiative transfer is computationally expensive, especially in 3D. To reduce the computational cost when utilizing a discrete angular discretization, we use a comoving frame interpretation of the radiative transfer equation. The main innovation of this paper lies in the novel stabilization method for the resulting numerical discretization. The stabilization method is able to reduce spurious oscillatory behavior in the computed intensities, at the expense of extra boundary conditions which need to be enforced. We also implement an adaptive angular discretization for the ray-tracing implementation, in order to efficiently and accurately calculate the radiation field. Finally, we apply this new numerical method to compute NLTE line radiative transfer on a hydrodynamics model, showcasing its potential improvement in computation efficiency.},

In this paper, we present the first long-term stable release of Magritte, an open-source software library for line radiative transfer. First, we establish its necessity with two applications. Then, we introduce the overall design strategy and the application/programmer interface (API). Finally, we present three key improvements over previous versions: (1) an improved re-meshing algorithm to efficiently coarsen the spatial discretisation of a model; (2) a variation on Ng-acceleration, a popular acceleration-of-convergence method for non-LTE line transfer; and, (3) a semi-analytic approximation for line optical depths in the presence of large velocity gradients.},

abstract = {Context. The dusty winds of cool evolved stars are a major contributor of the newly synthesised material enriching the Galaxy and future generations of stars. However, the details of the physics and chemistry behind dust formation and wind launching have yet to be pinpointed. Recent spatially resolved observations show the importance of gaining a more comprehensive view of the circumstellar chemistry, but a comparative study of the intricate interplay between chemistry and physics is still difficult because observational details such as frequencies and angular resolutions are rarely comparable.

Aims. Aiming to overcome these deficiencies, ATOMIUM is an ALMA Large Programme to study the physics and chemistry of the circumstellar envelopes of a diverse set of oxygen-rich evolved stars under homogeneous observing conditions at three angular resolutions between ~0.02″−1.4″. Here we summarize the molecular inventory of these sources, and the correlations between stellar parameters and molecular content.

Methods. Seventeen oxygen-rich or S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and red supergiant (RSG) stars have been observed in several tunings with ALMA Band 6, targeting a range of molecules to probe the circumstellar envelope and especially the chemistry of dust formation close to the star. We systematically assigned the molecular carriers of the spectral lines and measured their spectroscopic parameters and the angular extent of the emission of each line from integrated intensity maps.

Results. Across the ATOMIUM sample, we detect 291 transitions of 24 different molecules and their isotopologues. This includes several first detections in oxygen-rich AGB/RSG stars: PO v = 1, SO2 v1 = 1 and v2 = 2, and several high energy H2O transitions. We also find several first detections in S-type AGB stars: vibrationally excited HCN v2 = 2,3 and SiS v = 4,5,6, as well as first detections of the molecules SiC, AlCl, and AlF in W Aql. Overall, we find strong correlations between the following molecular pairs: CS and SiS, CS and AlF, NaCl and KCl, AlO and SO, SO2 and SO, and SO2 and H2O; meaning both molecules tend to have more detected emission lines in the same sources. The measured isotopic ratios of Si and S are found to be consistent with previous measurements, except for an anomalously high 29Si/30Si ratio of 4 ± 1 in the RSG VX Sgr.

Conclusions. This paper presents the overall molecular inventory and an initial analysis of the large ATOMIUM dataset, laying the groundwork for future work deriving molecular abundances and abundance profiles using radiative transfer modeling which will provide more rigorous tests for chemical models.},

title = {3D simulations of AGB stellar winds -- II. Ray-tracer implementation and impact of radiation on the outflow morphology},
volume = {674},
year = {2023},
abstract = {Context: Stars with an initial mass below ~8 Msun evolve through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, during which they develop a strong stellar wind, due to radiation pressure on newly formed dust grains. Recent observations have revealed significant morphological complexities in AGB outflows, which are most probably caused by the interaction with a companion.
Aims: We aim for a more accurate description of AGB wind morphologies by accounting for both the radiation force in dust-driven winds and the impact of a companion on the AGB wind morphology.
Methods: We present the implementation of a ray tracer for radiative transfer in the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code Phantom. Our method allows for the creation of a 3D map of the optical depth around the AGB star. The effects of four different descriptions of radiative transfer, with different degrees of complexity, are compared:  the free-wind approximation, the geometrical approximation, the Lucy approximation, and the attenuation approximation. Finally, we compare the Lucy and attenuation approximation to predictions with the 3D radiative transfer code Magritte.
Results: The effects of the different radiative transfer treatments are analysed considering both a low and high mass-loss rate regime, and this both in the case of a single AGB star, as well as for an AGB binary system. For both low and high mass-loss rates, the velocity profile of the outflow is modified when going from the free-wind to the geometrical approximation, also resulting in a different wind morphology for AGB binary systems. In the case of a low mass-loss rate, the effect of the Lucy and attenuation approximation is negligible due to the low densities but morphological differences appear in the high mass-loss rate regime. 
By comparing the radiative equilibrium temperature and radiation force to the predictions from Magritte, we show that for most of the models, the Lucy approximation works best. Although, close to the companion, artificial heating occurs and it fails to simulate the shadow cast by the companion. The attenuation approximation leads to stronger absorption of the radiation field, yielding a lower equilibrium temperature and weaker radiation force, but it produces the shadow cast by the companion. From the predictions of the 3D radiative transfer code Magritte, we also conclude that a radially directed radiation force is a reasonable assumption.
Conclusions: The radiation force plays a critical role in dust-driven AGB winds, impacting the velocity profile and morphological structures. For low mass-loss rates, the geometrical approximation suffices, however for high mass-loss rates, a more rigorous method is required. Among the studied approaches, the Lucy approximation provides the most accurate results, although it does not account for all effects.},
